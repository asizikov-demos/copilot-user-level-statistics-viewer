# Git Workflow

Manage the git workflow for this project. Follow these conventions strictly.

## Branch Naming

Create descriptive branch names using category prefixes:

- `feat/short-description` — new features
- `fix/short-description` — bug fixes
- `refactor/short-description` — code restructuring
- `chore/short-description` — maintenance, deps, config
- `security/short-description` — security fixes
- `ui/short-description` — UI/UX changes
- `improve/short-description` — improvements and optimizations

## Commit Conventions

Each commit must be **atomic** — one logical change per commit.

Commit message format: `prefix: short imperative description`

Prefixes: `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `test:`

Use `feat!:` or `fix!:` for breaking changes.

Rules:
- Run `npm run build` before each commit to verify no TypeScript or ESLint errors
- One logical change per commit — do not bundle unrelated changes
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- No period at the end of the subject line

## Pre-PR Review Gate

Before creating a PR, invoke the **Code Review** agent as a subagent to review all staged/unstaged changes. Address any issues it flags before proceeding with commits and PR creation. A PR should not be created until code review passes clean.

## PR Creation

After all commits are ready and pushed:

1. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
2. Create a PR with `gh pr create`
3. PR body must include a **summary table** of all commits:

```markdown
| Commit | Change |
|--------|--------|
| `fix:` description | What was fixed and why |
| `feat:` description | What was added |
```

4. Add test/build status: e.g., "Build: ✅ clean, Lint: ✅ clean"

## Post-Merge Cleanup

When told a PR is merged:

1. `git checkout main`
2. `git pull origin main`
3. Delete the merged branch locally: `git branch -d <branch-name>`
4. Confirm the local main is up to date

## Pre-Commit Verification

Before creating any commit, always:

1. Run `npm run build` — must exit 0 with no warnings
2. Run `npm run lint` — must exit 0
3. Review staged changes with `git diff --cached` to ensure only intended changes are included
4. If verification fails, fix issues before committing
